# batch_media_conveter

A simple bash script to convert videos on demand. The motivation is to automagically convert films / tv into a reasonable format for playback on tv / chromecast / phone through plex or jellyfin (jellyfin is the best btw!).

## Setup


## Todo
- systemd integration for starting as a service
- watch for changes in the directory through inotify somehow? Better than polling.
- empty directories are not removed
- setup docs
